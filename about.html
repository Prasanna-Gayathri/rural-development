        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Village Connect is dedicated to bridging the gap between rural communities and essential services. Our aim is to ensure every village has access to basic needs like medicine delivery, plumbing, and doctor visits.</p>
        
        <h2>Why We Developed This Project</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lack of Accessibility:</strong> Many rural areas lack easy access to essential services, which can lead to delayed or poor healthcare, untended plumbing issues, and missed medicine deliveries.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Efficiency:</strong> By centralizing services like medicine delivery and doctor visits, we aim to streamline these processes, making them more efficient and accessible.</li>
            <li><strong>Affordability:</strong> We are focused on making these services affordable for people in rural communities, especially those who may not have the resources to seek services in urban areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Awareness:</strong> Lack of awareness about available services is another challenge. This platform ensures that villagers are informed about the services they can access.</li>
            <li><strong>Empowering Rural Communities:</strong> The goal is to empower people in rural areas, allowing them to access quality services without the need to travel long distances or face financial barriers.</li>
        </ul>
